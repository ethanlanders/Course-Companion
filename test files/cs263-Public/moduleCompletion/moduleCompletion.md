This document outlines the completion of each Module for CS 263 in the form of
a traceability matrices.

The first section and table outline the completion of each module's structure
(e.g., overview and objectives). While the *Summary* is technically content...
I have included it here due to pedagogical conventions.

The second section and table outline the completion of module content.

The third section covers quiz and exam development.

# Module Content

The content for each module is broken down into the following:

  - Lecture - refers to any written content that a student must read
  - Video - refers to any video content that a student must watch
  - Lab - refers to any exercise that a student completes where the grade is for completion
  - Assignment - refers to any programming exercise that is graded for correctness
  - Quiz - refers to an end-of-module assessment that is either:
      - graded for completion
      - graded for correctness with an unlimited number of attempts

A "`-`" or an "N/A" in a cell represents that that specific module does not contain that type of material.
