Title: Review Course Structure, Objectives, and Requirements
TOC: yes
Author: Thomas J. Kennedy


While the syllabus is a bit of a dry read (as all syllabi tend to be)... a few
sections are particularly important during the first week of class.


# Course Learning Objectives

Make sure that you have reviewed the syllabus, specifically section 2.4
(Objectives).

> 
> The overall goal of this course is to *prepare students to write, design,
> refactor, and test code in Python at a level comparable to a student completing
> a 200-level programming course in C++ (CS250), Java (CS 251), or Python (CS
> 253) in preperation for 300-level and 400-level coursework.*
> 
> A student who successfully completes this course will be able to (in Python):
> 
>   1. Run a program consisting of a single file and containing a `main`
>      function.
>   2. Run a program consisting of multiple modules and containing a `main`
>      function.
>   3. Organize code into multiple modules.
>   4. Write tests for a module.
>   5. Apply the basics of test-driven development through PyTest and/or
>      `unittest`.
>   6. Make use of the various loops (for and while)
>       1. Compare the various loops (for and while)
>       2. Choose the most appropriate loop (for or while) for a given problem
>   7. Make use of the conditional blocks (i.e., if, if-else, and if-else-if-else).
>       1. Compare the various conditional blocks (i.e., if, if-else, and if-else-if-else)
>       2. Construct the appropriate conditional block (i.e., if, if-else, and if-else-if-else) for a given problem.
>   8. Test and write functions.
>   9. Design ADTs in accordance with the Class Checklist.
>   10. Discuss when polymorphism is appropriate.
>   12. Discuss when it is appropriate to utilize dataclasses, classes, and enums.
>   13. Write code that utilizes dunder functions.
>   14. Refactor code to follow best practices (e.g., PEP 8 and PEP 20).
>   15. Apply code linting tools (e.g., pylint and black) to write idiomatic
>       (Pythonic) code.
>   15. Discuss the various NumPy `np.array` mechanics (e.g., broadcasting).
>

# Textbooks and Supplemental Materials

Make sure that you have reviewed the syllabus, specifically section 2.1
(Textbooks)...


> 
> There is no required textbook.
> 

and section 2.2 (Supplemental Materials)...


> 
> All supplemental resources and materials will be available in Canvas
> 

# Technology Requirements

Make sure that you have reviewed the syllabus, specifically section 2.3
(Technology Requirements) and all subsections therein.


## Computer Accounts 

Make sure that you have reviewed the syllabus, specifically section 2.3.1
(Computer Accounts).

> 
> Students will need an account on the CS Dept. Unix network to participate in
> this class. This account is unrelated to any University-wide account you may
> have from the ODU's Information Technology Services (ITS).
> 
> If you have had a CS Unix account in the recent past, you should find it still
> active with your login name, password, and files unchanged. If you have had an
> account and it has not been restored, contact the CS Dept systems staff at
> root@cs.odu.edu requesting that it be restored.
> 
> If you do not yet have such an account, go to the <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/" target="_blank">CS Dept. home
> page</a> and look for "Account Creation" under "Online
> Services". All students in this course are responsible for making sure they
> have a working CS Unix account **prior to** the first assignment.
> 

## Compilers & Interpreters

Make sure that you have reviewed the syllabus, specifically section 2.3.2
(Compilers and Interpreters).

> 
> The "official" environment in which students' programming assignments will be
> evaluated is defined by our Dept. Linux servers. It is the student's
> responsibility to be sure that their code compiles and executes using the
> compilers and run-time environment provided there. As of this writing, the
> compiler versions used are
> 
>   -  C++: g++ 9.3.0
>   -  Java: 11.0.12
>   -  Python: 3.11
>
