Title: Why Learn Python?
TOC: yes
Author: Thomas J. Kennedy


# Motivation & Perspective

You may have asked yourself

> *Why should I learn Python if I already know Java?*

or

> *Why should I learn Python if I already know C++?*

My *elevator pitch* would include discussions of prototyping, data science,
machine learning, web programming, and automation. Yes... that is dangerously
close to *buzzword soup*.


# Readability

Python is a general purpose programming language (just like C++ and Java).
However, Python often reads like pseudocode or, sometimes, plain English.

Take a moment to consider the following code snippet...

```python
print(sum(range(1, 101)))
```

In the code we... `print` the `sum` of the `range` of numbers from `1` up to
(but not including) `101`.

*Of course... that is a bit of a forced example... and borderline
disingenuous.* A simple one-line program is not representative of Python as a
whole. However, Python tends to be an order of magnitude more readable than C++
and Java.


# Prototyping

Python can be used to prototype software, including

  - web applications (with frameworks such as
    <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/" target="_blank">Flask</a> or
    <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>)
  - web scrapers with
    <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a>
  - numerical analysis and regression (with <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a>)
  - data analytics (with <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a>)
  - generate graphs (with <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">matplotlib</a>)


# The Real Reason

No matter how much anyone tries to describe the benefits of Python, the
flexibility of Python, or the number or libraries available in Python (via
pip)... **the real reason to learn Python is accessibility.**

Python allows for procedural, objected-oriented, functional, or (even)
scripting style code. Anyone with an honest interest in Python can one of the
many beginner-friendly books (e.g., [Automate the Boring Stuff with
Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)) and write their first program in
a weekend.
