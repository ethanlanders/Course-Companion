00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:05,305
Welcome to CS 263 Python for Programmers.

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:09,275
This course is intended as an introduction
to Python for students already familiar

3
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:13,546
with another language
with an emphasis on C++ over Java.

4
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,984
The overall focus of this course
is to prepare to teach you how to apply

5
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:22,989
your existing knowledge
to write Python code. Tools of the trade.

6
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:28,728
In this course, we all use many tools,
including vim, Git, unit testing / test driven development,

7
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:32,866
pydoc, tox, pycode style / pylint

8
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,804
PlantUML and SDEdit

9
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:38,605
A few tools

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,608
will be used heavily for office hours
and questions.

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:46,312
Zoom for office
hours, email and questions. Yes,

12
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,950
I do realize that I have listed questions
as a tool for answering questions.

13
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,953
As much as I would like
to make a joke about recursion,

14
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,757
this is actually an instance
of the Socratic method.

15
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,626
Lecture examples.

16
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,629
Most lectures
will be based on the review examples.

17
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:08,635
If you are curious, take a look
at the commit history on GitHub.

18
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,904
The example code is not stagnant.

19
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,906
It is updated every semester.

20
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,976
Questions one: Do I need to know all
the tools listed in tools of the trade?

21
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,447
No, you do not need to know
all the tools.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,048
Two, why do you use them?

23
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,750
The short answer is that Vim works.

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,621
I can write code quickly, compile and run
code and switch between languages.

25
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,857
More importantly,
I can do everything completely

26
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,860
from the keyboard without the mouse.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,095
Three.

28
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,229
What is your favorite language?

29
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,232
It is currently a tie
between python and rust,

30
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:44,604
although it is currently python,
at least for today.

31
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,605
Four.

32
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,542
Can I ask you about a topic
not covered in lecture? Yes.

33
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,043
Five.

34
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,511
Who is Raymond Hettinger?

35
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,780
Raymond Hettinger
is one of the Python core developers.

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,251
He is known for his amazing
python talks slash lectures

37
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,188
beginning of the semester concerns

38
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,325
you will hear me discuss
and reference topics from various courses,

39
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:09,629
including CS 330 Object
oriented design and programing.

40
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,199
CS 361 Data structures and algorithms,

41
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,704
CS 381 discrete structures and CS 417

42
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,641
Computational methods and software.

43
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,743
Every semester, a few students end up

44
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,013
terrified that they have missed
a required prerequisite course.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,748
Before you start second guessing yourself,

46
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,751
take a look at the Prerequisites
section of the syllabus.

47
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,088
If a course is not listed
as a prerequisite, you are not expected

48
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:38,358
to have completed it.

49
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,393
Why mention other courses?

50
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,595
Computer science is a broad field.

51
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,231
There are many connections
between topics and concepts.

52
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,168
One of the biggest
mistakes anyone can make

53
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,870
is to
treat a course as existing in a vacuum.

54
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,840
This is especially true of teachers
and students.

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,108
Remember two things.

56
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,478
One, one of our goals is to learn
how to see these connections

57
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:04,050
and use them to solidify understanding
in this course and other courses.

58
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,986
I enjoy computer science,
including this course, and I have a

59
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,354
penchant to get carried away.
