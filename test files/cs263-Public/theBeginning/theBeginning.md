Welcome to CS 263 - Python for Programmers.


This course is intended as an introduction to Python for students already
familiar another language (with an emphasis on C++ or Java). The overall focus
of this course is to prepare to teach you how to apply your existing knowledge
to write *Pythonic* code.

**If you would prefer to read a written lecture... scroll past the video. The
written lecture covers the same material.**

# Tools of the Trade

In this course we will use many tools, including:

| Tool                 | Assignments   | Lecture   | Recordings   |
| :---                 | :------------ | :-------- | :----------- |
| Vim                  | Hopefully     | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| Git                  | Hopefully     | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| Unit Testing / TDD   | &#10004;      | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| Pydoc                | &#10004;      | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| Tox                  | &#10004;      | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| Pycodestyle / Pylint | &#10004;      | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| PlantUML             | Maybe         | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| SDEdit               | Maybe         | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |

A few tools will be used heavily for office hours and questions...

| Tool                | Assignments   | Lecture   | Recordings   |
| :---                | :------------ | :-------- | :----------- |
| Zoom (Office Hours) | &#10004;      |           |              |
| Email               | &#10004;      | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |
| Questions           | &#10004;      | &#10004;  | &#10004;     |

Yes... I do realize that I have listed questions as a tool for answering
questions. As much as I would like to make a joke about recursion... This is
actually an instance of the [Socratic
Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method).


# Lecture Examples

Most lectures will be based on the [Review (recorded lecture)
Examples](@gitRepoURL@). If you are curious... take a look at the [commit
history on
GitHub](https://github.com/cstkennedy/cs263-examples/commits/main). The
example code is not stagnant. It is updated every semester.


# Questions...

1. Do I need to know all the tools listed in <a href="#tools-of-the-trade" target="_blank">Tools of the Trade</a>?

    *No.* you do not need to know all the tools.

2. Why do you use Vim?

    The short answer is that... Vim works. I can write code quickly, compile
    and run code, and switch between languages. Most importantly, I can do
    everything completely from the keyboard (without the mouse).

5. What is your favorite language?

    It is currently a tie between Python and Rust... although it is currently
    Python... at least for today.


7. Can I ask you about a topic not covered in lecture?

    *Yes.* 

8. Who is <a href="https://github.com/rhettinger" target="_blank">Raymond Hettinger</a>?

    Raymond Hettinger is one of the Python core developers. He is known for his
    amazing Python talks/lectures.


# Beginning of the Semester Concerns

You will hear me discuss and reference topics from various courses, including:

  - CS 330 - Object Oriented Design & Programming
  - CS 361 - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - CS 381 - Discrete Structures
  - CS 417 - Computational Methods & Software

Every semester a few students end up terrified that they have missed a required
prerequisite course. Before you start second guessing yourself... take a look
at the [prerequisites section of the syllabus](doc:syllabus#prerequisites). If
a course is not listed as a prerequisite... you are not expected to have
completed it.

**Why mention other courses?**

Computer Science is a broad field. There are many connections between topics
and concepts. One of the biggest mistakes anyone can make (especially students
and teachers) is to treat a course as *existing in a vacuum*. Remember two
things:

  1. One of our goals is to learn how to see these connections and use them to
     solidify understanding in this course and other courses.

  2. I enjoy Computer Science (including this course) and have a
     penchant to get carried away.
