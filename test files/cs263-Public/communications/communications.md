Title: Communications - General Guidance
TOC: yes
Author: Thomas J. Kennedy


# This is not a "Set of Rules"

Most teachers have a set of rules labeled *communications* or direct you to
read an *Email Etiquette* document that contains phrases such as...

> *You are not writing a text message!*

Yes... the exclamation point is usually present.

\bSidebar

I do realize that the use of *facilitate*, *trepidation*, and *hesitation* in a
single sentence (complete with an ellipsis) could be unintentionally
intimidating.

**The irony is not lost on me!**

\eSidebar

While such *rules* are *usually* intended to facilitate discussion... they
*(The Rules)* lead to trepidation and hesitation.

At the end of the day... you are a person sending a message (email or Canvas
Message) to another person.


# Are Grammar and Style Important?

Yes... grammar and style are important... to a degree. You are not writing a
paper, journal article, or textbook. Your email is not being graded. The end
goal is clear communication. A few small typos are not an issue.

Before you send an email... take a few minutes to proofread.

  1. Are there any obvious spelling, grammar, or punctuation mistakes?
  2. Did you forget anything?
  3. If you used *bold* or *italicized* text... was it done sparingly?
  4. If you are referencing a document, piece of code, or other exercise... did
     you include a copy of your work?
  5. If you took a screenshot... was it done with your device's screenshot
     tools (e.g., the Windows Snipping tool)?


# How Much Formality is Appropriate?

The first question students ask is...

> What greeting should I use?

\bSidebar

You should probably avoid *Sup* or *Yo* as greetings. While I am not too
concerned with formality... that is a little too far.

\eSidebar

A simple *Hello*, *Good Morning*, *Good Afternoon*, or *Good Evening* is usually
sufficient.

The second question is usually...

> What if I think of another question after I click (or tap) *Send*?

Go ahead and send an amended (i.e., updated email) as a reply to your initial
message.

The last question is often...

> What if I have a lot of questions?

I have been known to have an abundance of answers.


# Important Information

Be sure to include the course subject and number (e.g., CS 263) any time that
you send an email to a teacher.

I teach multiple courses. I often have students who

  1. have taken courses with me in previous semesters.
  2. are currently taking two or more courses with me.

I have started a few emails with something along the lines of...

> Good Morning,
> 
> I am fairly certain that you are asking about Assignment 1 for CS 330. However,
> you are also taking CS 350 with me (and we discussed Assignment 1 for CS 350
> during office hours yesterday).
> 
> If I am mistaken... let me know.
