# Minimum Technology Requirements

Please review the University's [Technology
Guidelines](https://www.odu.edu/academics/student-computing/guidelines). The
**System Recommendations** are woefully incomplete:

  - **Operating System:** Linux is not listed (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch)
  - **Processor:** AMD Processors and Apple's custom silicon (e.g., M1 and M2)
    are not listed
  - **Video Cards:** AMD Radeon is not listed

If you have any questions about the suitability of your own setup be sure to
contact me during the first week of class.

ODU's Information Technology Services (ITS) describes a smattering of suggested
<a href="https://ww1.odu.edu/ts/security/awareness" target="_blank">Safe Computing Practices</a> to
protect your data and privacy. *Admittedly... a few of the recomendations come
across as pedantic to a Computer Science major.*

You will want to make note of the following links:

  - <a href="https://www.odu.edu/academics/student-computing/instructional-tools/canvas" target="_blank">Canvas for Students</a>
  - <a href="https://ww1.odu.edu/ts/new-student#tools" target="_blank">Technology Guide for Students</a>
  - <a href="https://www.odu.edu/ts/software-services/office365" target="_blank">Microsoft Office 365</a>
  - <a href="https://www.odu.edu/academics/student-computing/student-email" target="_blank">Student Email</a>

Canvas, Zoom, Email, and Office 365 are tools that you will need at some point
during your education.


# ITS Technical Support

Canvas provides support resources under the **Help** button in the Global

It is usually located on the far left side of your browser window.*

# Academic Support Services

ODU provides an overwhelming number of resources... especially at first glance.
However, these resources can be extremely useful. At the very least... take a
look at tutoring services and the [Computer Science Undergraduate Resource
Center (CSURC)](https://www.odu.edu/science-tutoring-centers/computer-science).
