# Class Checklist as a Collection of Emergent Properties

The class checklist can be though of as a set of emergent
properties (or, if you think as the table as a single entity, an emergent
property).

Depending on your programming background you will be familiar with C++, Java
(maybe both C++ and Java). Select (based on your background) either the C++ or
Java column. Compare it to the Python column.

| C++                                   | Java                              | Python 3                     | Rust                       |
| :------------------------             | :------------------------------   | :---------------             | :----                      |
| Default Constructor                   | Default Constructor               | `__init__`                   | `new()` or Default trait   |
| Copy Constructor                      | Clone and/or Copy Constructor     | `__deepcopy__`               | Clone trait                |
| Destructor                            |                                   |                              |                            |
|                                       | finalize (deprecated/discouraged) | `__del__`                    | Drop trait                 |
| Assignment Operator (=)               |                                   |                              |                            |
| Accessors (Getters)                   | Accessors (Getters)               | Accessors (`@property`)      | Accessors (Getters)        |
| Mutators (Setters)                    | Mutators (Setters)                | Setters (`@attribute.setter`) | Mutators (setters)         |
| Swap                                  |                                   |                              |                            |
| Logical Equivalence Operator (==)     | equals                            | `__eq__`                     | std::cmp::PartialEq trait  |
| Less-Than / Comes-Before Operator (<) | hashCode                          | `__hash__`                   | std::cmp::PartialOrd trait |
| Stream Insertion Operator (<<)        | toString                          | `__str__`                    | std::fmt::Display trait    |
|                                       |                                   | `__repr__`                   | std::fmt::Debug trait      |
| `begin()` and `end()`                 | `iterator`                        | `__iter__`                   | `iter()` and `iter_mut()`  |

  1. Think about why so many parallels exist between languages that support
     Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

  2. Think about the rule **Every Constructor must intialize every attribute
     (data member).**

  3. Think about [Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) as defined by
     cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii):

     *Resource Acquisition Is Initialization or RAII, is a C++ programming
     technique[1][2] which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be
     acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open
     socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database
     connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime of an
     object.*  

    - The Python `with` context management mechanic is an example of RAII.

  3. Think about output in the context of

     - `operator<<` in C++
     - `toString` in Java
     - `__str__` in Python 3
     - `std::fmt::Display::fmt` in Rust


# Focusing on C++ & Java

Let us take our Class Checklist Comparison Table and focus only on C++ and Java.

\bExample{C++ &amp; Java Class Checklist Table}

| C++                                   | Java                              |
| :------------------------             | :------------------------------   |
| **Default Constructor**               | **Default Constructor**           |
| **Copy Constructor**                  | **Clone and/or Copy Constructor** |
| Destructor                            |                                   |
|                                       | finalize (deprecated/discouraged) |
| Assignment Operator (=)               |                                   |
| **Accessors (Getters)**               | **Accessors (Getters)**           |
| **Mutators (Setters)**                | **Mutators (Setters)**            |
| Swap                                  |                                   |
| Logical Equivalence Operator (==)     | equals                            |
| Less-Than / Comes-Before Operator (<) | hashCode                          |
| Stream Insertion Operator (<<)        | toString                          |
|                                       |                                   |
| `begin()` and `end()`                 | `iterator`                        |

\eExample

If we look at the table... four rows (listed in bold) are immediately familiar:

  1. **Default Constructor** - all objects need to be initialized to some
     default state.

  2. **Copy Constructor & `clone`** - it must be possible to copy all objects.

    `clone` allows dynamic binding to be leveraged (which is the standard in
Java).

  3. **Accessors & Mutators** - the principles of encapsulation still apply.

The only difference between C++ and Java for each of these items is syntax. The
mechanics and conceptual approach are the same (barring a few pedantic
differences).

| C++                                   | Java                              |
| :------------------------             | :------------------------------   |
| Destructor                            |                                   |
|                                       | finalize (deprecated/discouraged) |
| Assignment Operator (=)               |                                   |
| Swap                                  |                                   |
| Logical Equivalence Operator (==)     | equals                            |
| Less-Than / Comes-Before Operator (<) | hashCode                          |
| Stream Insertion Operator (<<)        | toString                          |
|                                       |                                   |
| `begin()` and `end()`                 | `iterator`                        |

\eExample


If we strip out the four bolded rows, we are left with nine (9) rows. Let us
tackle a few...

  1. **Destructor vs `finalize`** - In C++ the destructor guarantees memory
     deallocation (e.g., calls to `delete` or `delete[]`).

     It is also common to shoehorn in some RAII (e.g., closing a file).
     However, `finalize` is not equivalent or analogous to Destructors (in the
     general case).

  2. **Assignment Operator** - Object variables in Python (and Java) behave a
     lot like C++ smart pointers (mostly like `std::shared_ptr`). Python (or
     Java) Garbage collection handles the rest.

  3. **Swap** - In Python (and Java) object variables are functionally fancy
     pointers. A Python (or Java) swap is conceptually a pointer swap.


We are left with...

\bExample{C++ &amp; Java Class Checklist Table - The Remainder II}

| C++                                   | Java                              |
| :------------------------             | :------------------------------   |
| Logical Equivalence Operator (==)     | equals                            |
| Less-Than / Comes-Before Operator (<) | hashCode                          |
| Stream Insertion Operator (<<)        | toString                          |
|                                       |                                   |
| `begin()` and `end()`                 | `iterator`                        |

\eExample

The next two rows are (in my opinion) more interesting:

  1. `operator==` vs `equals` - barring a few mechanical differences these two
     functions are equivalent.

  2. `operator<` and `hashCode` are **not** equivalent. However, they do serve
     similar purposes in each language's built-in libraries.

We are now left with:

  1. `operator<<` vs `toString` - these are both output functions (albeit with
     a few subtle differences).

  2. `begin` and `end` vs `iterator` - iterators are the focus of a separate
     lecture.
