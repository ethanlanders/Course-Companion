Title: Office Hours
TOC: yes
Author: Thomas J. Kennedy


As with all network conferencing, there are a few things to double check before coming to office hours:

You need a PC a good internet connection, a microphone, and headphones for
office hours.

  - **Headphones, not speakers!**  Even if it is just a pair of earbuds you
    normally use for listening to music.

    Zoom has decent background/ambient noise reduction. However, it can only do
    so much in a crowded room.


# Requesting an Appointment


1. Navigate to <https://www.cs.odu.edu/~tkennedy>.

    - This page lists my office hours. I am available via Network
      Conferencing (Zoom) during the listed times.

2. Click the _Schedule Appointment_ button.

3. My calendar will list appointment slots during my office hours.

4. Click on an appointment slot to create a meeting.

    - In the description, state whether you are requesting an individual or group
      meeting.

    - If you cannot find an appointment slot, or would like to meet outside the
      listed times, send me an email at <tkennedy@cs.odu.edu>

5. In a separate tab/window, check your email. You should an appointment confirmation email.

6. When it is time to join the meeting... click the Zoom link in the
   appointment confirmation.


# Cancelling or Rescheduling

# During Your Appointment

  1. Arrive a couple minutes early and check that your microphone and
     headphones are working.

  2. Have any discussion materials open (e.g., code, VSCode, or notes).

  3. You will be placed in a waiting room when you join the meeting.

  3. If a previous appointment is running a few minutes
     over. Wait a few minutes. I will extend our meeting as appropriate.
