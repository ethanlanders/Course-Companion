Title: Canvas Overview & Navigation
TOC: yes
Author: Thomas J. Kennedy


# Navigation Overview

The *Home Page* provides quick links to two resources:

  1. *Modules* where you will find links to all course materials. The *Course
     Overview* module can be found at the very top of the page. The *Course
     Overview* module includes:

      - [The Syllabus](doc:syllabus)
      - [Meet the Instructor](doc:meetTheInstructor)
      - Canvas Overview & Navigation **(this document)**
      - [Support](doc:support)

  2. The **Support** page...

      - references technical requirements defined by ODU's ITS
      - outlines resources available to students (including tutoring)
      - provides links to Academic Support Services
      - links to Canvas help resources

The *Home Page* contains my email and links to office hours (for quick
reference).


# Navigation Menu

The *Navigation Menu* contains (in order) the following items:

  1. Home
  2. Announcements
  3. Syllabus
  4. Modules
  5. Discussions
  6. Grades
  7. Assignments
  7. Course Collaboration Tool
  8. Media Gallery

As a general rule... I try to keep all materials *within two (2) clicks* of the
*Home* Page.


# Introduction to Canvas

[Canvas Student Tutorials (on
YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/@canvasstudenttutorials8303) covers how to
navigate Canvas, including the Dashboard and Global Navigation.

# Additional Canvas Resources


Instructure (the Company that built Canvas) maintains <a href="https://design.instructure.com/courses/178" target="_blank">Canvas Resources for Students</a> which provides guidance on the various features of Canvas.

  - You may want to explore how to [Update Your
    Profile](https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1074). This page allows
    you to specify how your information is displayed in Canvas (e.g., name).

  - I recommend that you take a few minutes to watch [Keep Track of Assignment
    Due Dates](https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1122) especially if you
    have not used Canvas's Calendar functionality before.

  - Make sure that you know how to [Check Your
    Grades](https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1131). I recommend that you
explore the *What If* functionality.


# Removed Content & Reasons

  - ~~<a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1127" target="_blank">Communicate with Your Instructor and Peers</a>~~ Instructure deprecated this page.
  - ~~<a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/videos/1121" target="_blank">Submit Your Assignments</a>~~
    This contradicts instructions in my course materials.
