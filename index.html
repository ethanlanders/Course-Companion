                <h1 style="padding-top:100px;">Problem Statement</h1>
                <p>Educators often face challenges in meeting the individual needs of students
                     <br>on the autism spectrum. They may lack awareness of how course materials could be inaccessible 
                     <br>to some students, and they may struggle to make necessary improvements to enhance accessibility.
                </p>

                <h1 style="padding-top:100px;">Problem Characteristics</h1>
                <p>Educators make sincere efforts to meet the educational needs of their students, though they may face challenges in addressing every student's needs.
                    <br>It's essential to acknowledge that educators are actively striving to enhance accessibility.
                    <br>Educators could benefit from additional support in their effort.
                </p>
                
                <h1 style="padding-top:100px;">Solution Statement</h1>
                <p>This desktop application assists educators in modifying their course material
                     <br> for increased accessibility and better alignment with student needs. It employs document scanning 
                     <br> to identify areas that may benefit from modifications by offering general suggestions.</p>
                <p>
                    <br>We will create a desktop application that will analyze course material, provide 
                    <br> relevant suggestions to increase accessibility for students, and provide a generated output report for educators.
                </p>
