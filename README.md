## Problem Description
Educators often face challenges in meeting the individual needs of students. Due to no fault of their own, they may lack awareness of how course materials could be inaccessible to some students, and they may struggle to make necessary improvements to enhance accessibility.

## Product Description
* Course Companion is a desktop application designed to help educators make their courses more accessible.

* Educators will input course material(s) and the program will be capable of analyzing the document(s). The analysis will consist of statistics such as average words per heading and/or number of heading levels. Once done, Course Companion will output a report with various suggestions based on the analysis. The user can then save the document and review it for later if needed.

## How To Run Software
There are two ways to run the software:
* Run in the terminal the command `python main.py` on MacOS or `py main.py` on Windows, making sure to include the path to main.py in the command in place of "main.py".
* Click the run button within your IDE while the file mile.py is selected and open.
